# 2.1.0

This release introduces a new output format: JSON result

Changes:
* Users module detects and prints user login time by default. Specifying `--users-compact` to disable it

* Reduced information supported by `--terminal-format`, `--shell-format`
* Some config presets (`devinfo` and `verbose`) are obseleted and removed. They are barely maintained and can be replaced with `--format json` now.

Features:
* Add `--format json`, which prints system information as JSON format
* Add fast path for xfce4 version detection (DE, FreeBSD)
* Support contour terminal version and font detection (Terminal / TerminalFont)

* Support Windows Service Pack version detection (Kernel, Windows)
* Support Debian point releases detection (OS, Linux)
* Add new module `NetIO` which prints network throughput (usage) of specified interface. Note this module costs about 1 second to finish.

* Fix terminal version and font detection on NixOS (Terminal, Linux)

# 2.0.0-beta

Fastfetch v2 introduces a new configuration file format: JSON config. Please refer to <https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/wiki/Configuration> for details.

Changes:
* Drop the dependency of cJSON. We now use [yyjson](https://ibireme.github.io/yyjson/doc/doxygen/html/index.html) to parse JSON documents.
* Remove `--shell-version` and `--terminal-version`. They are always enabled (Terminal / Shell)
* Remove `--*-error-format`, which seems to be useless
* Remove `--display-detect-name`. Display name is always detected, and will be printed if multiple displays are detected
* Deprecate `--set` and `--set-keyless`; they may be removed in future releases. Use JSON config with Custom module instead
* Remove the special handling of Command module (it can be set once in the triditional `config.conf`). Use JSON config with Command module instead
* Change `--wm-theme-*` to `--wmtheme-*`. Affect `key` and `format` (WMTheme)
* Change `--terminal-font-*` to `--terminalfont-*`. Affect `key` and `format` (TerminalFont)
* Module `Command` uses `/bin/sh` as the default shell on systems other than Windows (Command)
* Fix M2 CPU temperature detection (CPU, macOS)
* Detect monitor name when available, instead of using DRM connector name (Display / Brightness, Linux)

Features:
* FreeBSD support is improved greatly, and actually tested in a physical machine
* Add `--no-buffer` option for easier debugging. CMake option `ENABLE_BUFFER` is removed and always enabled.
* Support `--*-key-color` option to change the key color of specified module
* Support `--colors-symbol` and `--colors-padding-left` (Colors)
* Add LM (Login Manager) module. Currently requires systemd installed (thus Linux only)
* Add `--wmi-timeout` option (Windows)
* Add `--logo-type small` to search for small logos
* Support detecting brightness of external displays with DDC/CI (guard behind `--allow-slow-operations`) (Brightness)
* Add option `--size-ndigits` and `--size-max-prefix` (#494)
* Add option `--processing-timeout` to the timeout when waiting for child processes.
* Public IP module prints the IP location if `--publicip-url` is not set (PublicIP)
* Add option `--localip-default-route-only` (LocalIP)
* Add option `--weather-location` (Weather)
* Support iTerm non-ascii font detection (Terminal, macOS)
* Add option `--title-color-user`, `--title-color-at` and `--title-color-host` (Title)
* Add Exherbo logo and package manager count (Packages, Linux, #503)
* Add module `Terminal Size` which prints the number of terminal width and height in characters and pixels

* Fix `--brightness-format` (Brightness)
* Fix specifying `--set-keyless` with the same key second time won't override the value set before (#517)
* Fix specifying `--color` second time won't clear the value set before (#517)

Logo:
* Change the special handling of `kitty` protocol with `.png` image file to a new image protocol `kitty-direct`. This is the fastest image protocol because fastfetch doesn't need to pre-encode the image to base64 or something and the image content doesn't need to be transmitted via tty. Note:
    1. Although konsole was said to support `kitty` image protocol, it doesn't support `kitty-direct`
    2. wezterm support more image formats other than `.png` (tested with `.jpg` and `.webp`)
* Port all logos supported by neo(wo)fetch. Fastfetch now has 350 builtin logos in total.

# 1.7.0

This release brings support for MacOS!
The basics things are working, but it is far from feature parity with Linux.
I developed this in a VM, so bugs on real hardware are likely.
If you have a Mac and no idea what to do with your free time, i am very happy to accept pull requests / work on issues.

A lot of things were changed under the hood to make this possible, which should bring better performance and stability on all platforms.

Besides that, the following things have changed:

Features:
* The binary prefix used can now be configured, and is used consistently across all modules. Set `--binary-prefix` to `iec` (default), `si` or `jedec`.
* AMD GPUs now have a much better name, if the file `/usr/share/libdrm/amdgpu.ids` exists. For example my dedicated GPU, which was displayed as `AMD/ATI Radeon RX 5600 OEM/5600 XT / 5700/5700 XT`, is now `AMD Radeon RX 5600M`.

Logos:
* MacOS
* CachyOS small (@sirlucjan, #220)
* MSYS2 (#219)

* the `--file` option, which can be used to display the contents of a file as the logo, is now working again.
